MongoDB
MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. 
Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

NoSQL database - We don't use SQL commands to interact with
Collections => Collections used to store specific data records(like users, blog posts)
Documents => Each record in collections (llar to JSON object with Key/Value pair)

Benifits over SQL-DB
Documents in MDB are similar to JS /JSON object
Allows to store nested documents within documents(Book collections can have author property which is document itself)

SQL database - 
Relational databases
Made up of table/rows/columns
Table => table is used to store specific data type(like users, blog posts)
Rows => store user record(entity data)
Column => each column is a property in that record(fields/property of an entity )
